# Contributing

OpenBoardView encourage you to hack on the code and improve it. We also love it
when people send us those improvements!

We do have a few guidelines to follow when sending us fixes, this is intended to
keep the code base readable and consistent.

## Guidelines

#### Correcting existing styling

Feel free to fix up any mistakes in the code and send us a PR, however try to
avoid mixing unrelated style fixes into a feature or a bugfix. Instead make a new
branch for the style changes and submit them separately.

#### Whitespace

Try to use whitespace as an expression of how your code functions, good clear
spacing and indentation can make the difference between a readable code block
and a confusing one liner.

 - We use a single tab character for indentation.
 - Please remove any trailing whitespace (spaces at the end of the line)
 - Please include a single trailing newline at the end of a file

## Tools

We include a [Editor Config] file and a [clang-format] file in the project to
enable you to use automated tools to keep your code style consistent with the
existing code.
